      <h2>I am in the High School Debate team. The photo above is me at a summer debate camp in Iowa. <br></br>I am in Public Forum. Public Forum involves opposing teams of two, debating a topic concerning a current event. Proceeding a coin toss, the winners choose which side to debate (PRO or CON) or which speaker position they prefer (1st or 2nd), and the other team receives the remaining option. <br></br>Students present cases, engage in rebuttal and refutation, and also participate in a “crossfire” (similar to a cross examination) with the opportunity to question the opposing team. <br></br>Often times community members are recruited to judge this event. <br></br>To learn more about debate, click
